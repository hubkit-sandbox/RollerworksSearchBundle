RollerworksSearchBundle
=======================

The main purpose of this bundle is to integrate [RollerworksSearch](https://github.com/rollerworks/RollerworksSearch)
with any Symfony based application.

    RollerworksSearch provides a powerful searching system.

Requirements
------------

You need at least Symfony 3.3 (Symfony FrameworkBundle) and the Composer package
manager for installing dependencies.

For searching in storage engines you need install the additional search extensions.
They are then automatically enabled for you, but can be disabled with ease.

The documentation for RollerworksSearch and this integration bundle
can be found at [ReadTheDocs.io](http://rollerworkssearch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

**Note:** RollerworksSearch v2.0 is currently in ALPHA phase and documentation
